# red-onionring.js
red-onionring.js is an [onionring.js](https://garlic.garden/onionring/) fork with additional features:
- Customizable index widget that includes owner name, site title, url, description, and icon
- Option to alphabetically sort the webring and index page list
- Displaying the onionring widget on the index site shows separate text that can be modified
- The index widget displays a sites counter (how many sites in the webring)

### To Do
- Separate #index css out and create onionring-index.css
- Make a flag for sites counter so that it's optional
- Separate alphabetical sorting for the ring widget and index
- Separate text on index site without requiring the index site to be included in the ring
- Allow for either sites arrays to be populated instead of requiring the original sites array
- Link up the red-onionring.js github to the onionring widget
- Write up a "How To Use" tutorial
- General code and commenting clean up
